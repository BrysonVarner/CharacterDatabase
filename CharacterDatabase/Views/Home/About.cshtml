        <p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">
            This site was created to be my final project for the Software Development course
                    from <a style="font-size:25px;" href="https://truecoders.io/">TrueCoders</a>. Being a long time table top gamer, I happened to have a ton of old character
                    sheets sitting around that I can't seem to just throw away;  and also know the time it takes for a game master
                    to create partial characters to use as NPCs and enemies alike. I thought if there were others
                    that have as many old and un-used characters laying around, why not upload your characters
                    to a website where anyone can use them in their games and save the time and effort of rolling
                    up new ones? The idea for this was born from that idea and I hope that it sees its purpose achieved!
                    Game on!</p>
